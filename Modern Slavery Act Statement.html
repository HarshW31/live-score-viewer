        <h1>Modern Slavery Act Statement</h1>
        <p>LiveScore Group Limited and several of its subsidiaries, LiveScore Limited (Gibraltar), LiveScore Betting and Gaming (Gibraltar) Limited and Virgin Bet Limited (collectively, “LiveScore Group”) operate UK-facing businesses in a highly regulated industry and accordingly, legal and regulatory compliance are at the forefront of our business operations.

            LiveScore Group is committed to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking and requires compliance from our employees and suppliers with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
            
            For the purposes of this statement made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, LiveScore Group’s relevant offices are located in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar and the vast majority of our suppliers are based in either Europe or the United States of America. LiveScore Group develops and operates sports publishing and media, online sportsbook/gambling and gaming services.
            
            In light of where we do business, where our suppliers are based, and the industry in which we operate, we consider that there is a very low risk that modern slavery and human trafficking may affect our business. Our supply chain sectors primarily relate to typical services used in the general operation of our business such as information technology, marketing and professional services.
            
            Nonetheless, we adopt policies and procedures which are designed to:
            <ul>
                <li>ensure all relevant staff are alert to the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply chains;</li>
            <li> monitor potential risk areas in our business and supply chains;</li>
            <li>reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain; and</li>
            <li> provide protection to whistleblowers.</li>
           <li> We provide mandatory modern slavery training to the directors, senior leadership team and those employees of LiveScore Group who are engaged in key areas of the business pertaining to supply chains. Other employees are offered the modern slavery training modules more generally for their own learning.</li>
            </ul>
            We require employees engaged in the process for the selection of suppliers to conduct reasonable due diligence to ensure that there are not modern slavery and human trafficking risks affecting that supplier or partner. This may include (but is not limited to) raising enquiries with the supplier / partner or asking them to provide a copy of any relevant policies and/or their employee handbook.
            
            LiveScore Group has always chosen to work with reputable third parties across the various sectors that we engage in. Where appropriate we include contractual commitments and protections in our agreements with our suppliers. Where necessary, LiveScore Group requires those suppliers to implement effective systems and controls to prevent slavery and human trafficking from affecting any part of their business and supply chain.
            
            Our employees are advised to take particular care in respect of organisations that provide services from higher risk territories. Employees are also advised to notify LiveScore Group’s legal, compliance and HR teams immediately if they have any concerns so that LiveScore Group can then take appropriate action.
            
            In respect of LiveScore Group’s own employees, our Employee Handbook makes clear the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the organisation (including that we will not tolerate modern slavery and human trafficking affecting any part of our business or supply chain). We strive to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating and managing our supply chain.
            
            In addition, our HR and Recruitment teams continue to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws in the territories in which we are based. We seek to employ our own staff wherever possible which enables us to monitor working conditions and we only use specified, reputable employment agencies to source labour.
            
            We are proud of the work environment we provide to our staff and the vibrant culture that permeates our business. We will continue to maintain zero tolerance of modern slavery across the business.
            
            For more information on the structure and business of LiveScore Group and the wider group, please see our corporate website at www.livescoregroup.com. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2024 for LiveScore Group Limited and its subsidiaries LiveScore Limited (Gibraltar), LiveScore Betting and Gaming (Gibraltar) Limited and Virgin Bet Limited.
